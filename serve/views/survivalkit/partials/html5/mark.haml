    element
    %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/text-level-semantics.html#represents"} represents
    a run of
    text in one document marked or highlighted for reference purposes,
    due to its relevance in another context. When used in a quotation or
    other block of text referred to from the prose, it indicates a
    highlight that was not originally present but which has been added
    to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text that might not
    have been considered important by the original author when the block
    was originally written, but which is now under previously unexpected
    scrutiny. When used in the main prose of a document, it indicates a
    part of the document that has been highlighted due to its likely
    relevance to the user's current activity.
