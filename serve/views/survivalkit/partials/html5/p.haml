      The little kitten gently seated himself on a piece of
      carpet. Later in his life, this would be referred to as the time the
      cat sat on the mat.

      There was once an example from Femley,
      %br
        Whose markup was of dubious quality.
        %br
          The validator complained,
          %br
            So the author was pained,
            %br
              To move the error from the markup to the rhyming.
