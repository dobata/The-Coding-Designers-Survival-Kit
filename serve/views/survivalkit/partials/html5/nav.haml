    The
    %code
      %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-nav-element"} nav
    element
    %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#represents"} represents
    a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.
  %p
    Not all groups of links on a page need to be in a
    %code
      %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-nav-element"} nav
    element — only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the
    %code
      %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-nav-element"} nav
    element. In particular, it is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site, such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page. The
    %code
      %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-footer-element"} footer
    element alone is sufficient for such cases, without a
    %code
      %a{:href => "http://developers.whatwg.org/sections.html#the-nav-element"} nav
    element.

  %p A nav element doesn't have to contain a list, it can contain other kinds of content as well. In this navigation block, links are provided in prose:

        you can see a large mountain, upon which many

        Another more
        boring-looking exit is labeled
